# Kaia's Binox

## This project is for Kaia's BioMedical Mechatronics solution, for short KaiaBinox, referring to the binocular type design for the biomedical solution.

### This Biomedical solution aims to assist Kaia in navigation of schools and the identification of humans to be able to move through school to find friends without the use of a cane that Kaia finds hard to understand or use.

In the folder there is the empathy maps, flow charts, psudocode, and UAT testing documents that explain and help the development of this design

In future we will work on this project and this folder will contain coding, developments documentation, and trial data.

Project workers:

GIANFRANCO MANIELI - ULTRASONIC SENSOR, data output and input control, right left and center, aswell as distance detection.

ELLIOTT PEZZUTTI - SMART HUMAN SENSOR, data output and input control, human angle and distance detection.

ALEX LUU - LED MATRIX, UAT TESTER, managment of US and SMART HR sensors to have relative distance and pos output.
